<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">us hasten onward devouring the vision of a plum-cake.</p><p>Here are pleasures, as some people would say, of a more exalted kind, in the window of a bookseller. Is Annie a literary lady? Yes; she is deeply read in Peter Parley's tomes and has an increasing love for fairy-tales, though seldom met with nowadays, and she will subscribe next year to the <em>Juvenile Miscellany</em>. But, truth to tell, she is apt to turn away from the printed page and keep gazing at the pretty pictures, such as the gay-colored ones which make this shop-window the continual loitering-place of children. What would Annie think if, in the book which I mean to send her on New Year's day, she should find her sweet little self bound up in silk or morocco with gilt edges, there to remain till she become a woman grown with children of her own to read about their mother's childhood? That would be very queer.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Little Annie is weary of pictures and pulls me</p></div> </div>
